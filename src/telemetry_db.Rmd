# Save Telemetry To Database

To make the telemetry data easier to use, it makes sense to load it into a database rather than have to search through various files and repeatedly clean the data.

This section describes a recipe for processing rich telemetry datafiles that have been saved into single directory.

The filename includes metadata that is mixed into the data saved to the database.

```{r}
# Load in a single file and clean the data
